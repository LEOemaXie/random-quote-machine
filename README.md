# Random Quote Machine 
This fetches quotes in a format and displays it randomly to the user. It was built as part of the solution to my projects to freeCodeCamp.

## Overview
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for their devices
- Get random quotes
- Return to the previous quote
- Tweet the quote

## Challenges
The challenges I faced was how to keep track of generated random quotes and display them when the user clicks on the arrow. Also I had to figure a way to fetch the large JSON file of quotes without affecting the display of other components.

## What I Learnt 
- How to fetch and parse JSON from APIs
- The complexities of React Class Components as opposed to functional components

## Tools And Technology
- HTML5
- Mobile First Workflow
- CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
